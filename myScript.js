function 
//let the function run when the user enters a valid option.
//let the function be named computerPlay
// create a variable to store the users' choice: userInput
// If users' input is valid - trigger a function that produces a random computer output from the array userOptions and store it 
//in a variable called randomOutput
//Once generated. Compare the randomOutput to the userInput using < >. 
//Establish the winners. Rock >scissors. scissors>paper, paper>rock
//If userInput is greater than randomOutput alert "you win", else "you lose"
